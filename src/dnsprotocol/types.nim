The domain name terminates with the zero length octet for the null label of the root. Note that this field may be an odd number of octets; no padding is used.
    qtype*: QType ## A two octet code which specifies the type of the query. The values for this field include all codes valid for a TYPE field, together with some more general codes which can match more than one type of RR.
    qclass*: QClass ## A two octet code that specifies the class of the query. For example, the QCLASS field is IN for the Internet.

  Questions* = seq[Question] ## It is an alias for `seq[Question]`

      version*: uint8 ## Indicates the implementation level of the setter.  Full conformance with this specification is indicated by version '0'. Requestors are encouraged to set this to the lowest implemented level capable of expressing a transaction, to minimise the responder and network load of discovering the greatest common implementation level between requestor and responder.  A requestor's version numbering strategy MAY ideally be a run-time configuration option. If a responder does not implement the VERSION level of the request, then it MUST respond with RCODE=BADVERS.  All responses MUST be limited in format to the VERSION level of the request, but the VERSION of each response SHOULD be the highest implementation level of the responder.  In this way, a requestor will learn the implementation level of a responder as a side effect of every response, including error responses and including RCODE=BADVERS.

      class*: Class ## Two octets containing one of the RR CLASS codes.
      ttl*: int32 ## A 32 bit signed integer that specifies the time interval that the resource record may be cached before the source of the information should again be consulted. Zero values are interpreted to mean that the RR can only be used for the transaction in progress, and should not be cached. For example, SOA records are always distributed with a zero TTL to prohibit caching. Zero values can also be used for extremely volatile data.
    rdlength*: uint16 ## An unsigned 16 bit integer that specifies the length in octets of the RDATA field.
