  RDataSOA* = ref object of RData
    mname*: string ## The <domain-name> of the name server that was the original or primary source of data for this zone.
    rname*: string ## A <domain-name> which specifies the mailbox of the person responsible for this zone.
    serial*: uint32 ## The unsigned 32 bit version number of the original copy of the zone.  Zone transfers preserve this value.  This value wraps and should be compared using sequence space arithmetic.
    refresh*: uint32 ## A 32 bit time interval before the zone should be refreshed.
    retry*: uint32 ## A 32 bit time interval that should elapse before a failed refresh should be retried.
    expire*: uint32 ## A 32 bit time value that specifies the upper limit on the time interval that can elapse before the zone is no longer authoritative.
    minimum*: uint32 ## The unsigned 32 bit minimum TTL field that should be exported with any RR from this zone.

  RDataMB* = ref object of RData
    madname*: string # A <domain-name> which specifies a host which has the specified mailbox.

  RDataMG* = ref object of RData
    mgmname*: string ## A <domain-name> which specifies a mailbox which is a member of the mail group specified by the domain name.

  RDataWKS* = ref object of RData
    address*: array[4, uint8] ## An 32 bit Internet address
    protocol*: uint8 ## An 8 bit IP protocol number
    bitmap*: string ## A variable length bit map. The bit map must be a multiple of 8 bits long.

  RDataMINFO* = ref object of RData
    rmailbx*: string ## A <domain-name> which specifies a mailbox which is responsible for the mailing list or mailbox.  If this domain name names the root, the owner of the MINFO RR is responsible for itself.  Note that many existing mailing lists use a mailbox X-request for the RMAILBX field of mailing list X, e.g., Msgroup-request for Msgroup.  This field provides a more general mechanism.
    emailbx*: string ## A <domain-name> which specifies a mailbox which is to receive error messages related to the mailing list or mailbox specified by the owner of the MINFO RR (similar to the ERRORS-TO: field which has been proposed).  If this domain name names the root, errors should be returned to the sender of the message.

  RDataMX* = ref object of RData
    preference*: uint16 ## A 16 bit integer which specifies the preference given to this RR among others at the same owner.  Lower values are preferred.
    exchange*: string ## A <domain-name> which specifies a host willing to act as a mail exchange for the owner name.

    priority*: uint16 ## The priority of this target host.  A client MUST attempt to contact the target host with the lowest-numbered priority it can reach; target hosts with the same priority SHOULD be tried in an order defined by the weight field.  The range is 0-65535.  This is a 16 bit unsigned integer in network byte order.
    weight*: uint16 ## A server selection mechanism.  The weight field specifies a relative weight for entries with the same priority. Larger weights SHOULD be given a proportionately higher probability of being selected. The range of this number is 0-65535.  This is a 16 bit unsigned integer in network byte order.
    port*: uint16 ## The port on this target host of this service.  The range is 0- 65535.  This is a 16 bit unsigned integer in network byte order.
    target*: string ## A <domain-name> which specifies a host willing to act as a mail exchange for the owner name.
